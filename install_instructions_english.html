        <h1>Release Notes:</h1>
    </a>
    <p>Version 0.7.2.2(g) is recommended for new installs. Updating older versions of OpenBiblio is highly
        recommended because the most important changes are for hardening security.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.</p>

    Known limitations:
    <ul>
        <li>MARC is not stored perfectly in the database tables (issue 1, fixed in obiblio-10-wip).</li>
        <li>UTF-8 multibyte characters: very limited support in reports and possibly issues with search (issue 19).</li>
        <li>If you have not updated to 64 bit PHP before some day in the year 2038: days late and late fee not
            calculated, incorrect timestamp calculations for holds (issue 51).

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <div class="notice">Steps 1-8: detail is out of date, but the basics are still valid.</div>
    <ol>
        <li>To use your system for OpenBiblio you have to install a webserver, PHP and MySQL. If you didn't done it
            already, i recommend to use <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> for this
            installation, because this includes all the needed programs in one installation (of course except
            Openbiblio). XAMPP is ditributed for <a
                    href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">Windows</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html">Linux</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html">MacOS X</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-solaris.html">Solaris</a>. The Windows-Version doesn't
            run with Windows ME, because there are problems with Apache2 (there are TCP/IP-Problems under Win ME). If
            you use Win ME or a other not mentioned system, please use the manual installation (since point 4),
            otherwise continue with point 2. (i want to thank Christopher Dagleish for the hint to XAMPP :-))
        </li>
        <li>Download <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> in the version, which your system
            needs, the Lite-version is sufficient but i recommend the full version nevertheless (this version offers
            regulary updates...). Following install the downloaded XAMPP (the installation is described on the site of
            the corresponding XAMPP-version in english, so i didn't explain it here, but please read everything there
            :-)). Now you should start XAMPP (it's explained there how) and you have a running Apache, PHP and MySQL.
            Continue now with the installation of OpenBiblio at point 7.!
        </li>
        <li>The following points 4-6 you only have to do, if you didn't installed XAMPP (or XAMPP doesn't run):</li>
        <li>Install a web server such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> that is compatible with PHP. If
            you install Apache, get familiar with starting and stopping your Apache Web Server. If you are running
            Windows 95 or Windows 98 there will be "Start Apache" and "Stop Apache" icons that will help you start and
            stop your web server. You may want to consider adding the "Start Apache" icon to your startup folder. If you
            are running NT or Windows 2000 you can add Apache as a service which will be running, even if you are logged
            off. If you are running Linux your Apache server should be packaged with your Linux installation and will
            start when you start Linux. <b>Attention: Under Windows ME there are much reports about problems with Apache
                2.0.x (in my practice it doesn't run, as long as i had installed networkcards, the tcp/ip-driver of ME
                seems buggy), take Apache 1.3.33 in this case.</b>
        </li>
        <li>Add PHP to your web server as a CGI or a module. If you are using Apache 2.0, I would highly recommend that
            you install PHP as a module instead of a cgi application. In my experience the Apache PHP module performed
            over 4 times faster than the cgi PHP. See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache2.php">Example
                3-9. PHP and Apache 2.0 as Module</a> in the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</a> for
            more info on how to install PHP as a module.
            <p>OpenBiblio uses session data. Therefore, you will need to make sure PHP sessions are turned on. Be sure
                to create a directory for your session data on your server and specify the session.save_path in your
                php.ini file. The default php.ini sets session.save_path to "/tmp". Therefore, you have to create a
                directory called c:/tmp (for Windows) users. However, I usually create a more descriptive name inside my
                PHP directory and then change my php.ini file to match it.
            <p>Example php.ini directive:
            <pre>session.save_path = d:\PHP\sessiondata</pre>

            <p>See section <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php">XCIII. Session handling functions</a>
                in the PHP manual for more details on PHP sessions.
        </li>
        <li>Install the MySQL database from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>. Get familiar with
            starting and stopping your MySQL Server. See <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/W/i/Win95_start.html">Starting
                MySQL on Windows 95 or Windows 98</a> for more information.<br><br>If you are running NT or Windows
            2000, setup MySQL as a service so it starts whenever the machine powers up. See <a
                    href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/N/T/NT_start.html">Starting MySQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000</a>
            for more information on starting MySQL as a service.<br><br>
            If you are running Linux, MySQL should be packaged with your Linux installation and will start when you
            start Linux.
        </li>
        <li>The following points are describing the installation of OpenBiblio and have to be done from everything, who
            install OpenBiblio at the first time (never mind if you use XAMPP or installed apache, PHP and MySQL on a
            other way):
        </li>
        <li>Get familiar with logging into MySQL with your admin account within a DOS prompt window. You can use the
            following command sequence as a test.
            <blockquote><pre>
C:\><b>c:\mysql\bin\mysql -uroot mysql</b>
Enter password: <b>*********</b>

            wasn't possible to use a real password function. I'm only using a secret word, which is stored in plain text
            and is readable in plain text by the librarian.</p>
        <p>The following explains how to set up the user login (version 0.7.2g), since it does not work without this
            additional setup.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to Openbiblio at <a href="http://localhost/openbiblio/index.html">http://localhost/openbiblio/index.html</a>
                and change to the admin area.
            </li>
            <li>Change to Member Fields and add a new custom field.
            </li>
            <li>The new field must necessarily have the code "secret". In the description you can choose the name
                itself, I'm using here "Secret Word". Press Submit.
            </li>
            <li>From now you can use user login at <a href="http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/index.html">http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/index.html</a>.
            </li>
            <li>At the memberinfo you can now define the secret word. Once this is filed, this member can login at <a
                    href="http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/loginform.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/loginform.php</a>
                with his card number an his secret word to renew his items or to place a hold. If a member has no secret
                word, an info appears, that he has to give a secret word to the librarian.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </a>

        <h1>Updating from a previous version of OpenBiblio:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Rename your old openbiblio installation directory so that you don't lose its contents. We'll call the
                old directory openbiblio-old.
            </li>
            <li>Copy the new openbiblio directory and all of its contents into the directory where the old openbiblio
                installation was.
            </li>
            <li>Copy the database_constants.php file from the openbiblio-old directory into the new openbiblio
                directory, replacing the database_constants.php file there.
            </li>
            <li>Backup your database. See your MySQL documentation for instructions. (use mysqldump)
            </li>
            <li>Update your OpenBiblio database tables by using the conversion tool located at <a
                    href="http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php</a>,
                assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs directory. When installed on a remote
                host, the first part of the address will be different. If the tables are already OK, the tool will say
                so.
            </li>
            <li><strong>For security:</strong> Remove the openbiblio/install directory completely
                to prevent unauthorized use of install or upgrade tools. If present, also remove the openbiblio/tests
                directory.
            </li>
            <li><strong>For security:</strong> Verify that the <tt>display_errors</tt> setting in php.ini is 'Off' to
                prevent unintended information disclosure.
            </li>
        </ol>
